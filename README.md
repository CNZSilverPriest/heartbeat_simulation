❤️ Beating Heart Animation ❤️

A mesmerizing, colorful beating heart animation created with Python's Tkinter. This program generates a dynamic heart that pulsates with random color patterns, surrounded by a glowing halo effect.

## Features

- 🎨 Multi-colored heart with 15 different color variations
- 💓 Realistic beating animation using mathematical functions
- ✨ Glowing halo effect that pulses with the heartbeat
- 🌀 Random particle generation for organic movement
- 📝 Customizable parameters for size, colors, and animation speed

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python installation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CNZSilverPriest/heartbeat_simulation
   cd beating-heart
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python beating_heart.py
   ```

## Customization

You can easily modify the program by changing these parameters in the code:

- `HEART_COLOR_LIST`: Change the color palette
- `CANVAS_WIDTH`/`CANVAS_HEIGHT`: Adjust the window size
- `IMAGE_ENLARGE`: Change the heart size
- `generate_frame` in `Heart` class: Adjust animation smoothness
- `70` in `main.after()`: Change animation speed (milliseconds)

## How It Works

The animation uses:
- Parametric equations to generate the heart shape
- Logarithmic functions for particle distribution
- Sine waves to create the beating effect
- Randomization for organic movement and color variation

Tips for enhancing your README:
1. Add an actual GIF demo (you can record your screen with tools like LICEcap)
2. Consider adding a "Contributing" section if you want others to help improve it
3. You might add a "Future Improvements" section with planned features
4. For a more professional look, add shields.io badges for Python version, license, etc.
